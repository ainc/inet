            <h1>Pitch Tips</h1>
            <p >
              <ul>
                <li>Pitches must be less than 150 seconds (yes, we are so serious about this that we said it again)</li>
                <li>Make sure you tell us what type of business you are starting.
                  <strong>Example:</strong> <i>"My idea is for a tandem bike service that transports students around UK."</i></li>
                <li>If you have an analogy that makes understanding your idea simple, make sure to include it. 
                  <strong>Example: </strong><i>"My idea is to create Tinder for people over 85 years of age."</i></li>
                <li>Make sure you tell us how your idea will make money.
                  <strong>Example:</strong> <i>"Our software product will secretly round off the decimals of bank transactions and deposit them into an offshore account."</i>(Please don't do this: it's just a movie reference.)</li>
                <li>If you have an awesome name for your product or service, please, please share it. <strong>Example:</strong> Snuggie (if they called it “Blanket with Sleeves”, this amazing product may have never made Scott Boilen a millionaire many times over.)</li>
              </ul>
        </p>
            <h1>How to upload a YouTube Video</h1>
              <p>Follow <a href='https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en'><strong>these instructions from Google</strong></a> on how to upload a YouTube video.</p>   
              <p>Alternatively, ask your friend, or any 9-year-old with an iPad. </p>
        <p>The idea for this contest comes courtesy of the University of Michigan's <a href="http://mpowered.umich.edu/">MPowered Entrepreneurship</a> organization and their <a href="https://1000pitches.com" alt="1000 pitches">1000 Pitches</a> contest, which started way back in 2007. Our goal is to capture that spirit right here in the Bluegrass, on UK's campus. Both iNET and Awesome Inc want to see students unafraid to throw out new ideas in order to stimulate creativity and entrepreneurial conversation in the community.</p>
