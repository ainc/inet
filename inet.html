                <li>Pitches should be no more than 150 seconds (2:30 minutes).  We will stop watching/caring at the 2:30 minute mark, so keep it simple and to the point.</li>
                <li>Pitches must be given by a current student enrolled at the University of Kentucky.  Both full time and part time students are eligible. </li>
                <li>Group pitches are allowed as long as all participants are students enrolled at UK.</li>

Hope can drive a man insane. Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? Well, now let me see. </p>-->
